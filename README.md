## TwitterSentimentAnalyzer
End-to-end machine learning project about Twitter sentiment analysis. The project covers the entire process, starting from data collection and preprocessing, LSTM model building, creating a dashboard, and finally deploying the model and dashboard as an online application. You can read the comprehensive guide (including the code walkthroughs) in the following articles:
